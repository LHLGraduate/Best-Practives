# GitHub Profile ToDos for new Lighthouse Labs Graduates
Almost every employer you talk to will want to see your Github
profile. It tells a story about who you are as a developer;
the story of what they can expect from your as an employee.  It's
therefore critical you present yourself in the best way.  This document
is a collection of tips to help you get the most out of your online
persona.

## Public Profile
Your public profile is, in many cases, your first digital impression with
a perspective employer.  Make sure you represent yourself in the same
manner that your would in any professional environment.  That's not to say
you can't have fun.

### Profile Photo
A profile photo is a necessity.  It's the largest design element on your profile
page and as such will make your profile feel complete.

### Bio
The Bio is a great place to express your goals and objectives.
What type of projects do you want to work on?  What are your goals?  Are you
looking for a new role?

### Contributions
If your contributions graph doesn't show consistent coding habits there's a
good chance you won't be called in for an interview.  Write code regularly,
even if it's just a refactor; challenge your skills with code katas; start a side project; or
contribute to open source.  All these activities will help you be a better developer and land that
dream job!

* [Trending in Open Source](https://github.com/trending) - Trending Repositories on GitHub.
* [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/) - Practice is the best teacher!

Not all your contributions will be in public repositories, so make sure you set
your profile to include your contributions from private repositories!

## Be Social

One of GitHub's best features is all the social goodness that allows you to
connect with open source projects and developers from around the world!  These
features are also a good way to show a perspective employer what your interested
in and that's your continuing your learning by following other developers.

### Starred Repositories
Starring a repository is a great way to bookmark a repository, show some love
for a fellow developer or just tell an employer your engaged.  Don't go too crazy
but find some cool open source projects and star them.

### Follow influential Developers
Following influential developers can be a great way to continue your learning
and it will show potential employers that you're interested in continuing your
learn and keeping up with the latest technology.

## Repositories

### Why the README is important
README files are a great way to provide context for your repository. They're also an 
opportunity to describe what challenges your encountered and how they were solved.
Remember, the person screening your profile for the first time isn't always going to be
technical.

### Contributors in Group Projects
For your group project repositories make sure you list of each contributor and
what part of the project was your responsibility.  Although GitHub provides
amazing tools like commit graphs, history and blame not every employer has the
time to dig into your repos. Grab their attention by telling them what you worked
on and even linking to the code you're most proud of.
